# Glitterbomb
Glitterbomb is a project I dump python scripts for "dealing" with scammers and bad people online.
Inspired by Mark Rober's Glitter Bomb series.

I'm tired of massive companies such as YouTube, Roblox, etc. not giving a shit about the insane amount of scam ads and inappropriate content they host on their platform.
So I decided to take the matter into my own hands.

# Warning
I am not responsible in any way how you use, utilize, implement this software.

# Quick Heads-up
All of these scripts require python knowledge. If you don't meet that requirement, I would not suggest you use these.

# Roblox Mass Reporter
This tool lets you mass report ANY account on Roblox. 
Inlegitimate reports can get you suspended.

How to use:
- Run the scripts
- Wait for it to open the browser
- Fill in the `user_id` field located in the console
- Fill in the `report_selection_index` field located in the console with an integer between 1-15
- Fill in the `report_text` field located in the console with the reason of your report.

You're done, use CTRL + C to exit.
